* The Sound of Silence

  Hello darkness my old friend

  I've come to talk with you again

  Becasue a vision softly creeping

  Left its seeds while I was sleeping

  And the vision that was planted in my brain

  Still remains

  With the sound of silence

  In restless dreams I walked alone

  Narrow streets of cobblestone

  Neath the halo of a street lamp

  I turned my collar to the cold and damp

  When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light

  That split the night

  And touched the sound of silence

  And in the naked light I saw

  Ten thousand peopel maybe more /θɑʊznd/

  People talking without speaking /wɪ:ðɑʊt/

  People hearing without listening

  People writing songs that voices never share

  No one dared

  Disturb the sound of silence

  Fools said I you do not know

  Silence like a cancer grows

  Hear my words that I might teach you

  Take my arms that I might reach you

  But my words like silent raindrops fell

  And echoed in the wells of silence

  And the people bowed and prayed

  To the neon god they made

  And the sign flashed out its warning

  In the words that it was forming

  And the sign said The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

  And tenement halls

  And whispered in the sounds of silence
